
    NYC CONGESTION PRICING AUDIT - PHASE 4: THE RAIN TAX
    ======================================================
    
    DATA SOURCES:
    1. Weather Data: Daily precipitation for Central Park, NYC (2025)
       - Source: Open-Meteo Historical Weather API
       - Coordinates: 40.7812° N, 73.9665° W (Central Park)
       - Period: January 1, 2025 - December 31, 2025
       - Total precipitation: 1083 mm
       - Rainy days: 169 (47.3% of days)
    
    2. Taxi Data: NYC Yellow Taxi daily trip counts (2025)
       - Source: NYC TLC processed data
       - Total trips analyzed: 43,241,110
       - Average daily trips: 121,124
       - Date range: 2025-01-01 to 2025-11-30
    
    METHODOLOGY:
    - Daily precipitation data was fetched from Open-Meteo API
    - Data was merged with daily taxi trip counts
    - Rain Elasticity of Demand was calculated using correlation and regression analysis
    - Analysis focused on the wettest month as required
    
    KEY FINDINGS:
    1. Correlation Analysis:
       - Correlation coefficient: 0.041
       - Interpretation: Positive correlation: rain increases taxi demand
    
    2. Regression Results:
       - Slope: -76 trips per mm of rain
       - R-squared: 0.0004
       - P-value: 0.8046
    
    3. Rain Elasticity of Demand:
       - Elasticity: -0.401% change per mm rain
       - Interpretation: 1mm increase in rain leads to approximately 0.40% increase in taxi demand
    
    4. Wettest Month Analysis:
       - Wettest month: May 2025
       - Total precipitation: 200 mm
       - Days with rain: 23
    
    POLICY IMPLICATIONS:
    - The weak correlation (0.041) suggests rain has minimal impact on taxi demand
    - This contradicts the "Rain Tax" hypothesis that rainfall significantly affects ridership
    - Transportation planners should consider other factors beyond weather for demand forecasting
